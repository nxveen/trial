This is the same measurement the leaderboard uses, printed instead of stored:
build/release/duckdb - which has your extension linked into it - runs the whole
set in one CLI process, so your cache keeps its session state across queries;
each query runs under EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, FORMAT JSON), so its result is never
materialised into the terminal; a throwaway warm-up pass runs first, so no timed
run pays for reading the database off disk; and the score is the geometric mean
of the query times of the *fastest whole run*.

It does not check your answers. A fast wrong answer scores nothing on the
leaderboard, so use `make test` for correctness.
